## Tech behind GRIZZLY
Following classical Ethereum flash loan arbitrage we migrated the following model (shown below) to Binance Smart Chain. Polygon & Fantom chains are next. We use however loaned funds from Uniswap V2-V3 like DEXs with 0.3% fee on each flash loan. In the future we plan to fork DXDY and make own pool with 0% fee for flash loans for everyone on #BSC.
