## Tech behind GRIZZLY
Following classical Ethereum flash loan arbitrage we migrated the following model (shown below) to Binance Smart Chain. Polygon & Fantom chains are next. We use however loaned funds from Uniswap V2-V3 like DEXs with 0.3% fee on each flash loan. In the future we plan to fork DXDY and make own pool with 0% fee for flash loans for everyone on #BSC.

## Rewards 
Rewards are distributed automatically from our smart contract that holds flash loans execution functions. We have fixed timeframe of 30 days (based on Unix timestamps) to airdrop BNB (as Wrapped BNB) to GRIZZLY wallets (not contracts, only use addresses) equivally. Everything is 100% transparent and on-chain. In addition to rewards GRIZZLY has 50% tax implemented to charge everyone on any transfers. Essentially 45% tax when you sell it on Pancakeswap comes as a reward for holders and 5% as a liquidity generation fee into the pool of Pancakeswap GRIZZLY/BNB pair.
